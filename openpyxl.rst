| Line blocks are useful for addresses, 
| verse, and adornment-free lists. 
| 
| Each new line begins with a 
| vertical bar ("|"). 
|     Line breaks and initial indents 
|     are preserved. 
| Continuation lines are wrapped 
  portions of long lines; they begin 
  with spaces in place of vertical bars.
